## How to Start

The following sub-sections provide the detailed instructions.

### Deploy to k8s

#### Pure Helm

Refer to the [**Helm guide**](docs/public/installation.md#helm).

### How to Debug

Refer to the Mistral's [Guide](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-mistral/-/blob/master_qs/README.md).

### How to Troubleshoot
There are no well-defined rules for troubleshooting, as each task is unique, but there are some tips that can do:
* Deploy parameters.
* Application manifest.
* Logs from all Mistral services. Mostly all problems will be in *engine* service logs, but others should be checked too. 
* As Mistral depends on Postgres, RabbitMQ and partly on Kafka, there can be connection problems

Also, developer can take a look on [Troubleshooting guide](/docs/public/troubleshooting.md).
